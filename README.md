# AI-Image-Generation

This is a ChatGPT powered project that generates image based on user's input description.
I have used NodeJS and ExpressJS to build the project that uses OpenAI's Dall-E models to generate images.

To run the project, follow the below steps:

1. Create a .env file and paste your ChatGPT API key in that
   i.e. OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_KEY'

2. Run **npm install** command to install the dependencies
3. Then run **npm start** to start the project
